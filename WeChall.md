# login.wrapper.php #

The relevant values are:

  * tables: chess\_users - gwf\_user
    * rows: user\_id - user\_id
    * rows: user\_name - user\_name
    * rows: user\_password - user\_password
  * scripts: login.wrapper.php - /modules/Login

At the moment, I don't know how I can use the login-module from WeChall for community chess.

The row currentChessSoftware in the table chess\_players is also a problem. I should possibly add a new table with the current chess software to player correlation.
