# Top-Level-Domain #
I bought .com for Community Chess. I thought of the following before I bought it:

  * com: _commercial_
    * original intended purpose for domains registered by commercial organizations. However eventually the distinction was lost when .com, .org and .net were opened for unrestricted registration.
    * this TLD is well known and recognized as an URL by everybody
  * .org: _organization_ - originally intended for non-profit organizations or organizations of a non-commercial character that did not meet the requirements for other gTLDs
  * .net: _network_ - originally intended purpose for organizations involved in networking technologies, such as Internet service providers and other infrastructure companies
