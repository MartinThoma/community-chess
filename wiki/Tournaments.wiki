#summary What are tournaments and how do they work?

= Introduction =

A tournament is a competition involving a relatively large number of active chess players, but by far not the whole community.

= Principles of a tournament =
I will try to achieve a fair tournament system according to these principles:
  # The best player should be on position 1, the second best player should be on position 2, ...
  # Only chess knowledge and not luck with your opponents should lead to a high ranking in a tournament
  # As few as possible time which has to be spend on playing with other player should be spent. I don't want to force the best player to resign from the top ranking just because other players can spent night over night with playing chess.

= Why didn't you use ... =
== Single-elimination tournament ==
  * *Draw* is possible in chess
  * *Bad ranking*: Imagine the best player plays against the second best in the first round. The second best player will rank as high as the worst player.
  * The *number of players* in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament Single-elimination tournament] sould be a a power of two.

== Double-elimination tournament ==
In [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-elimination_tournament Double-elimination tournament] more games have to be played than in single elemination. This results in a much better ranking, but *draw* and the *number of players* are still a problem.

== Round-robin tournament ==
In a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament Round-robin tournament] every player has to play twice against every other player. This means (n*n - n)/2 games have to be played. I would like to have at least 20 players in every tournament. This would mean 190 games have to be played. This seems to be too much for me. 

Additionally, I guess that many player will be quite inactive which will  lead to easy wins.

= Implementation =
Every tournament can be splitted into parts:
  # *Opening Phase*: Players may register for participation.
  # *Match Phase*: The players play against other players. 
  # *Computation Phase*: Compute the result of the tournament.

Idea: Use the PageRanking algorithm.
