Which TLD should I choose?

.com: _commercial_
  * original intended purpose for domains registered by commercial organizations. However eventually the distinction was lost when .com, .org and .net were opened for unrestricted registration.
  * this TLD is well known and recognized as an URL by everybody

.org: _organization_ - originally intended for non-profit organizations or organizations of a non-commercial character that did not meet the requirements for other gTLDs

.net: _network_ - originally intended purpose for organizations involved in networking technologies, such as Internet service providers and other infrastructure companies
