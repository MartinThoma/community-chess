#summary How should moves be submitted to the server?

= Introduction =
The moves are submitted like simply by giving a gameID-parameter and a move-parameter via GET to playChess.php:
`www.yourserver.com/chess/playChess.php?gameID=1&move=7274`

Keep in mind that you have to submit your session variables, too.



Think of the chess board as fields with coordinates:

You always give two coordinates: from and to. In the example given above, from is 72 and to 74. So if this is your first move, you will move your pawn.

= Promotion =
If one of your pawns reaches the base line of the opponent, it [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(chess) promotes]. You have to submit which chess piece you would like to get (q, r, b, n. Take a look at ChessPieces). Its not case-sensitive. So you submit your move like this:
`www.yourserver.com/chess/playChess.php?gameID=1&move=8788q`

= Castling =
If you like to do [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling castling], you submit only the move of your king.
