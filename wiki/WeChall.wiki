#summary How can community chess be used with WeChall-Code? A little tutorial.

= login.wrapper.php =

The relevant values are:

  * tables: chess_players - phpbb_users
    * rows: id - user_id
    * rows: uname - user_name
    * rows: upass - user_password
  * scripts: login.wrapper.php - /modules/Login

At the moment, I don't know how I can use the login-module from WeChall for community chess.

The row currentChessSoftware in the table chess_players is also a problem. I should possibly add a new table with the current chess software to player correlation.
