#summary Which medals should the game have?

= Introduction =

Medals can be given players for various reasons. Here are some ideas:


== Fast player ==

It is important for the game, that players continue their games quite fast. If the sum of time the player needed to respond is smaller than 1 hour (no matter if he won or not), he will be given the fast player medal

== Supporter ==

This medal may only be given to a player by a former winner of a tournament. He can give this medal to other players, if they gave him hints how to win a chess game.

== Turnament winnter ==

Awarded when a turnament is won.
