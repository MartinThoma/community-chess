#summary Which medals should the game have?

= Introduction =

Medals can be given players for various reasons. Medals are only given for good things, so you won't have any negative medals.

Here are some ideas:


== Fast player ==

It is important for the game, that players continue their games quite fast. If the sum of time the player needed to respond is smaller than 1 hour (no matter if he won or not), he will be given the fast player medal

== Supporter ==

This medal may only be given to a player by a former winner of a tournament. He can give this medal to other players, if they gave him hints how to win a chess game.

== Grandmaster ==

Awarded when a turnament is won.

== Code Supporter ==

Awarded if code the player gave some piece of code to this project

== Security supporter ==

Awarded if the player hinted to some security relevant problems (if it seems to be severe, please mail it directly to me: info@martin-thoma.de)
