= Set up version =
Download the latest code:
{{{
# Non-members may check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP.
svn checkout http://community-chess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ community-chess-read-only
}}}

  * Download the [http://www.phpbb.com/downloads/olympus.php?from=submenu latest version of phpBB] and put it in community-chess/forum
  * Install phpBB3
  * Make everything I mentioned in install/phpBB3
  * Download the [http://www.phpbb.com/languages/ german language pack]

= Create a downloadable version =
{{{
find community-chess/ -path '*/.*' -prune -o -type f -print | zip ~/community-chess.zip -@
}}}

= Translations =
This will come soon. You might want to take a look at:
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poedit Poedit]
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_gettext GNU gettext]

The translations are located at community-chess/i18n.

= PDO =
You can debug PDO problems with:

{{{
print_r($conn->errorInfo());
var_dump($stmt);
$stmt->debugDumpParams();
}}}

It is sometimes helpful to [http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/8865/do-i-have-to-make-any-more-check-if-i-use-prepared-statements-for-integers activate SQL-logging] and add `$conn->query("SELECT 1");`. This way you can see which statements get executed.
