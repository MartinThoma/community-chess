#summary How can community chess be used with phpBB? A little tutorial.

Some people might want to integrate Community Chess into [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB phpBB3]. Some reasons could be:
  * *Higher security*: Although I used mysql_real_escape_string and sometimes intval() to make it not too easy to use MySQL-Injections, I am quite sure that the phpBB3 developers thought of much more vulnerabilities
  * *Existing project*: As the name suggests, I wrote Community Chess for some specific communities. They might already have their registered users. I don't want to force them to register for my software. There is no use in doing so.

Here is what I've figured out so far:

= My setup =
  # Download [http://www.phpbb.com/downloads/olympus.php?from=submenu phpBB 3.0.9]
  # Standard MySQL-installation
  # Deleted install directory
