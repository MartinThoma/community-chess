Chess figures are from Wikipedia Commons. See

I downloaded them at 18:13, 13.08.2011

According the the pages, all files are licenced "GFDL & BSD & GPL". So I hope 
it's not a problem if I use them for community-chess.

If you created a better set, just let me know. I'll add it to community chess.
