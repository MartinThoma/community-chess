4.  Execute phpbb.sql
5.  Copy phpbb3.php to the main Community Chess folder

       copy it to the main folder)
7.  Replace wrapper.inc.php by phpbb3.wrapper.inc.php
      (so you rename phpbb3.wrapper.inc.php to wrapper.inc.php and 
       copy it to the main folder)
8.  Adjust '../phpBB3/' in wrapper.inc.php if neccessary.
9.  Adjust constants in constants.inc.php:

     * Change USER_NAME_COLUMN to 'username'
10. Add the following line to challengePlayer.php in line 26 to exclude Bots:
