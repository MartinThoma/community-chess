1. Have a working phpBB3 installation
2. Copy all Community Chess files in a own folder.
   It doesn't matter if its within phpBB3 or not, but for updating it should
   have its own folder.
3. Execute chess.sql
4. Execute phpbb.sql
5. Replace login.wrapper.php by phpbb3.login.php
   (so you rename phpbb3.login.php to login.wrapper.php and 
    copy it to the main folder)
5. Replace wrapper.inc.php by phpbb3.wrapper.inc.php
   (so you rename phpbb3.wrapper.inc.php to wrapper.inc.php and 
    copy it to the main folder)
